= Introduction =

jZebra offers 3 modes of printing:  Command line, desktop application, and *web applet*.  The most common use (and most developed for) is *web applet* mode.  This is due to the popularity of using web pages for thermal, bar code and magnetic printing.

== Creating a basic web applet ==

To get started, download the latest jZebra from [http://code.google.com/p/jzebra/downloads/list downloads] and extract the contents to your desktop.  
   * Make sure to extract the entire contents at once so that the folder and file structure stays in tact.
   * Locate the html sample file.  Windows users can use *notepad*.  Linux users can use *gedit*.  This should be called "preview-application.html".  Look over the applet code quickly to get comfortable with the parameters.
   * Close out "preview-application.html" and use the same text editor to make a new file.  Start by inserting the code to create the applet.
{{{
<html><body>
   <applet code="jzebra.JZebraApplet.class" archive="./jzebra.jar" width="200" height="25">
      <param name="buttontext" value="Sample button">
   </applet>
</html></body>
}}}
  * Save the file in the same folder as jzebra.jar and open the file with the browser of your choice.

_*Note:* IE7 users may be required to " [http://www.mix-fx.com/flash-prompt.htm Click to Activate This Control]", so Firefox is recommended for initial testing._
  *  Click the "Sample button".  It will most likely do nothing, this is normal.  What is important is that the output is checked in the Java console. _*Note:*  Windows users can enable this by right clicking the Java system tray icon and clicking "[http://img74.imageshack.us/img74/2423/jzebrajava1tx5.png Open Java Console]"._
  * If you already have a zebra printer attached to your station, the applet will try to automatically use it by searching for the name "zebra" in all of your attached printers.  

_*Note:* If you do not have a printer named "zebra", then you will have a "*SEVERE: Printer not found*" in your log.  To fix this, create a dummy printer with "zebra" in the name as a place holder for the purpose of learning this applet.  "zebra fake" as a printer name works for now.  Windows and Linux both allow this._
  * Look in the Java console log for something like follows.  You should see the default raw commands that jZebra ships with.

_*Note:* These aren't intended for use with your printer, they're provided as an example.  You will be changing these commands for your printer next._

== Sending raw commands to your printer ==
Assuming your printer is attached and set up as a "Generic/Text Only" printer _(don't use the vendor supplied driver, use plain text mode instead)_ we're now ready to print some raw commands.  To do this, three parameters need to be added to the web applet.  *CONFIGTYPE*, *CONFIGPATH*, *LINEFEED*.
  * *CONFIGTYPE*:  Set this to "*FILE*" with the following parameter: _(this can later be changed to a web url using "url")_
{{{
      <param name="configtype" value="file">
}}}
  * *CONFIGPATH*:  Set this to a location on your hard drive.  Windows users should use a location that's simple for now, such as the root of C:\.  Linux users should place this in the user's home directory.
{{{
      <param name="configpath" value="c:\test.txt">
}}}
  * Create the config file with notepad (or equivalent), and add some raw commands of your choice.  Follow your ZPL (or printer language) guide and keep it simple for now.
  * *LINEFEED*:  In order for your printer to separate the raw commands, you must send a linefeed that corresponds with your printer language.

_*Note:*  Newline is "\n", Carriage Return is "\r".  Your printer may need any combination of these or other characters.  If unsure, visit your printer programming manual. If other escape sequences are needed, search for the java equivalent online and replace._
{{{
       <param name="linefeed" value="\n">
}}}

  * If done correctly, you should now have your web applet printing.  Next step is  substitution of print commands.

== Command Substitution ==
  * To perform substitution of print commands, simply place a "*$*" dollar sign infront of a variable in your config file.  These substitutions were illustrated in our sample above.

  * Name your variables as you wish so as long as they match your applet code as follows:
{{{
      <param name="FIRSTNAME" value="TRES">
}}}

_This will replace all occurrences of *$FIRSTNAME* with the applet value specified.
